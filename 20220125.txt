	Write an empty text file named "ssh" (no file extension) to the root of the directory of 
	the card. When it sees the "ssh" on its first boot-up, Raspberry Pi OS will 
	automatically enable SSH (Secure Socket Shell), which will allow you to remotely access 
	the Pi command line from your PC.

	# To setup a Wi-Fi connection on your headless Raspberry Pi, create a text file called 
	# wpa_supplicant.conf, and place it in the root directory of the microSD card. You will 
	# need the following text in the file.

	country=US
	ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
	update_config=1
	
	network={
	scan_ssid=1
	ssid="your_wifi_ssid"
	psk="your_wifi_password"
	}
